# Assignment 6 - Project Reflection

## Overview
This project analyzes customer spending patterns using datasets from previous assignments.

## Decision on Merging Assignment 5
I decided to merge Assignment 5 because it introduced important improvements to data quality and project structure. Specifically:
1. Enhanced Data Completeness – Assignment 5 included additional datasets, such as MOCK_CUSTOMER_DATA.xlsx, which provided a more comprehensive view of customer spending patterns.
2. Better Project Structure – Assignment 5 introduced a more organized file structure, making it easier to manage different components like scripts and data files.

## Lessons Learned
- How to clean and manage large datasets.
- How to use Git to track project changes.
- Importance of organizing data correctly.
